    <h1>Hi, <span class="orange">I'm Jiad.</span> <br> I Love To Create Websites!</h1>
    <h3>Creating Websites That Engage Users. Coffe? Won't mind!</h3>
    <p class="motto">" This was really a passion for me to learn the web development and being a web developer. When I started to learn web dev related stuffs in 2018 I was enjoying. Day by day I was doing my progress but somehow my father got some health issues and he had to take some surgeries in his backbone. So I have to give up all the hope about my learning and I left all my activities related to web development. Somehow my dream was broken and I stopped! But recently I got some fuel by 'Programming Hero' in my dreams and again I started to get myself back on the way of fulfiling my dream. Now I strongly believe that within 2021 I will land my first job as a Web Developer, inshaAllah! "</p>
